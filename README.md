### one important question
- **how do i get better?**
- **what did i do to get better?**

- measurment is at the heart of agile
- we need to measure the process
  - learn to measure the process
 
- copying is good
  - call it borrowing brilliance

- Agile uses wisdom of the team to get the best solution
- Leadership
  - anyone can show leadership
  - everyone is a leader

- take time to think and learn

Team dynamics:
- you need to trust eachother
- 2 important values:
  - courage
  - openness

# Agile principles
- Begin with clarity about the outcome, and let it guide every step along the way
  - ask the customer what they want, find out what is uselss and what is important
- Listen, iterate, learn and course correct rather than wait until it's perfect
- encourage self-direction for teams to unleash innovation instead of concentrating leadership in the hands of a select few
  - hard: we are used to be told what to do. leadership is in everyone's hands
- focus on the customer and business vlaue
- iterative and fast
- flexible, adaptive, and continuously improving
- collaboration and teamwork
- empowered and self directed teams

# Agile values
- trust
- respect
- openness
- courage
- culture

## Trust is a set of expectations

## Importance of conflicts
- have conflicts while also respecting the person.
- this is how innovation happens

## Your values are the ones that you walk past
### Example:
- if you see someone disrespecting someone on the street and you just walk by, disrespect is one of your values
  -  nobody is calling it up
  
### You can only deliver as fast as the slowest part of your process
- the trick is for you to find the bottleneck then address it.

# Focus on one thing at a time
- phenomen is called **switching loss**
- when you change from one task to another, you get less done

- manage the funnel
- prioritize backlog
- work smarter

# Leaders need to focus on doing the right work and the work right
# Work in progress limit. Don't do too many things at a time

# Agile is about time boxing
- sprints are important
- if a task is given 3 months, it takes 3 months to do even if it can be done in one week

# Agile frameworks
- less
- scrum


# Stand-ups - daily meetings
- be punctual
- talk to the card
- what did they do yesterday
- what's planned and left to-do
- blockers in reaching deadline
- make notes to discuss offline
- keep it short and to the point
- take longer discussions offline
- make a note of who does not have work
- move the card only after talking to it
- pull a new card if needed
- never embarass anyone in public
- have the hard conversation in private
- update the virtual wall later

# Retrospectives
- think what you can do better
- iteration managers should keep retrospectives safe without blame
- 5 why's
- every iteration
- we hold retrospectives to learn and improve


### Identify and fix bottlenecks
- you are as fast as your bottleneck
  - reasons for bottlenecks are many.. Either skills are lacking or no motivation to work on it
